## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
install.packages("ggcorrplot")
library(ggcorrplot)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```
Goals: 
- predict neighborhood / county by price 
- predict price by square footage 
- find relationships between year and price 
- predict # of beds by price or price by number of beds 
- maybe do something with embeddings for the titles for more info about home - correlate with price


```{r}
Rent_df = tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2022-07-05')
```

```{r}
Rent = Rent_df$rent
Permits = Rent_df$sf_permits
Construction = Rent_df$new_construction
```

# Data Cleaning: 

```{r}
